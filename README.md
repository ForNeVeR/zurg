# Escape from Zurg

See the following article for full problem explanations and some sample solutions:
[M. Erwig - Escape from Zurg: An Exercise in Logic Programming](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~erwig/papers/Zurg_JFP04.pdf).

## The problem

Buzz, Woody, Rex, and Hamm have to escape from Zurg. They merely have to cross
one last bridge before they are free. However, the bridge is fragile and can hold at most
two of them at the same time. Moreover, to cross the bridge a ﬂashlight is needed to
avoid traps and broken parts. The problem is that our friends have only one ﬂashlight
with one battery that lasts for only 60 minutes (this is not a typo: sixty). The toys need
different times to cross the bridge (in either direction):

* Buzz: 5 minutes
* Woody: 10 minutes
* Rex: 20 minutes
* Hamm: 25 minutes

Since there can be only two toys on the bridge at the same time, they cannot cross the
bridge all at once. Since they need the ﬂashlight to cross the bridge, whenever two have
crossed the bridge, somebody has to go back and bring the ﬂashlight to those toys on
the other side that still have to cross the bridge.

The problem now is: In which order can the four toys cross the bridge in time (that
is, in 60 minutes) to be saved from Zurg?

## Usage

Use `lein run` to run the program. It will print some debug output and, finally, a list of possible solutions.
